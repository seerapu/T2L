        When deploying to a production Looker instance, you might encounter issues. Here are common debugging steps:

        1.  **Verify Looker API Credentials**:
            * Double-check `base_url`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` in your `looker.ini`.
            * Ensure the API user has **developer permissions** for the Looker project and instance.
            * Test connectivity using a simple Looker SDK script outside of this app.

        2.  **Git Integration Checks**:
            * **Local Git Status**: After generation, check your local `lookml_files` directory and your Git repository status. Are the new/updated files staged and committed?
            * **Remote Repository**: Verify that your changes are pushed to the remote Git repository that your Looker project is connected to.
            * **Looker Project Configuration**: In Looker (Admin -> Project), ensure your LookML project is correctly configured with the Git repository URL, SSH key (if used), and branch.
            * **Deploying in Looker**: After pushing to Git, you typically need to "Deploy to Production" from within the Looker IDE or use the `deploy_project_to_production` API endpoint if automating.

        3.  **Generated LookML Syntax**:
            * **Looker IDE Validation**: Even if the conversion script runs, the generated LookML might have syntax errors not caught by the script. Open the generated files in the Looker IDE and use the **LookML Validator** to identify issues.
            * **Linter Errors**: Pay attention to any linter warnings or errors in the Looker IDE.
            * **Data Explorer**: Test the views and explores in Looker's Explore UI to ensure they correctly query your database.

        4.  **Database Connection Issues**:
            * Ensure the `connection` name in your generated LookML models (`.model.lkml` files) matches an existing database connection in your Looker instance (Admin -> Databases -> Connections).
            * Verify the Looker connection has the necessary permissions to access the underlying database tables.

        5.  **Logging and Error Messages**:
            * **App Logs**: Check the logs of this Streamlit app for any Python exceptions during conversion or simulated deployment.
            * **Looker Logs**: If you have access to Looker server logs, these can provide deeper insights into deployment failures or LookML parsing issues.

        6.  **Dependency Conflicts (Python Environment)**:
            * Ensure all necessary Python libraries (e.g., `looker_sdk`, `lxml`, `python-dotenv`, `streamlit`) are installed and their versions are compatible. Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to manage dependencies.

        7.  **File Paths and Permissions**:
            * Verify that the Streamlit application has write permissions to create the `lookml_files` directory and write `.lkml` files.
